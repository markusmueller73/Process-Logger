# Process-Logger
Small and invisible tool to monitor the duration of running processes.

# Usage:
  --config    write a new fresh config in the user directory
  --select    show a small dialog to select the processes (executeable files) to monitor
  --report    create a simple HTML report in the users TEMP directory
  --help      show this help

  If you start the app without any parameters, it opens an invisible window and monitor the processes.
  You can close it in the windows task manager.
